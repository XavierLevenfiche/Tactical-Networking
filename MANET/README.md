# MANET Experiments

This folder contains experiments and documentation for **Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs)**, focusing on tactical deployment, routing, and field simulations.

## 🔹 Contents

- `simulations/` – Network topology simulations and scripts
- `routing/` – Example routing configurations and observations
- `subnet-management/` – Notes on subnet assignments, IP schemes
- `logs/` – Packet loss, latency, and RSSI logs
- `diagrams/` – Network topology diagrams

## 🔹 Usage

1. Browse `simulations/` for scripts or configs to reproduce network topologies.
2. Use `routing/` examples to understand protocol performance.
3. Consult `logs/` for historical field data.
4. Add your own experiments and clearly document settings and results.

## 🔹 Notes

- Record all node positions, distances, and configurations for repeatability.
- Include any GPS coordinates or mapping outputs in `diagrams/`.

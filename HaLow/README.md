# HaLow / IEEE 802.11ah Experiments

This folder covers **HL2, DiamondNet, and HaLow mesh experiments**, including field deployment, antenna testing, and RSSI/MCS monitoring.

## 🔹 Contents

- `nodes/` – Configs for HL2s, Rockets, and Mango devices
- `antenna-tests/` – SMA cable losses, gain measurements, and placement notes
- `rssi-mcs-logs/` – Packet loss, MCS, and signal strength logs
- `network-topologies/` – Mesh layouts and diagrams

## 🔹 Usage

1. Use `nodes/` configs for deploying HL2 or DiamondNet nodes.
2. Track antenna placement and cable length effects in `antenna-tests/`.
3. Log RSSI, MCS, and packet loss in `rssi-mcs-logs/`.
4. Include diagrams in `network-topologies/` for reference.

## 🔹 Notes

- Document all environmental conditions (line of sight, obstacles).
- Track firmware versions and mesh passwords for reproducibility.

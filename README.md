# Tactical Networking

This repository contains my research, field experiments, and lab documentation on tactical mesh networking. It combines practical setups, device testing, scripts, and tools for advanced wireless networks including MANETs, Meshtastic, HaLow, AREDN, OpenWRT, and more.

## 🔹 Repository Overview

I focus on **real-world, field-deployable mesh networks** and network performance analysis. The repo includes:

- **MANETs**: Mobile Ad-hoc network setups, routing experiments, subnet management.
- **Meshtastic**: LoRa-based field communication, device pairing, firmware tweaks.
- **HaLow (IEEE 802.11ah)**: HL2 setups, Rocket/Mango integration, antenna experiments, RSSI & MCS monitoring.
- **AREDN**: Mesh configurations, emergency network experiments, subnet & routing strategies.
- **OpenWRT**: Mesh firmware setups, device bridging, and automation scripts.
- **RTL-SDR**: Signal scanning, drone & Wi-Fi detection, remote ID experiments.
- **Network Tools & Scripts**: Python & PowerShell scripts for Tailscale, ping sweeps, network mapping, logging, and visualization.
- **Field Documentation**: GPS-based site mapping, distance measurements, coverage heatmaps, and antenna/cable experiments.

## 🔹 Repository Overview

I focus on **real-world, field-deployable mesh networks** and network performance analysis. The repo includes:

- **MANETs**: Mobile Ad-hoc network setups, routing experiments, subnet management.
- **Meshtastic**: LoRa-based field communication, device pairing, firmware tweaks.
- **HaLow (IEEE 802.11ah)**: HL2 setups, Rocket/Mango integration, antenna experiments, RSSI & MCS monitoring.
- **AREDN**: Mesh configurations, emergency network experiments, subnet & routing strategies.
- **OpenWRT**: Mesh firmware setups, device bridging, and automation scripts.
- **RTL-SDR**: Signal scanning, drone & Wi-Fi detection, remote ID experiments.
- **Network Tools & Scripts**: Python & PowerShell scripts for Tailscale, ping sweeps, network mapping, logging, and visualization.
- **Field Documentation**: GPS-based site mapping, distance measurements, coverage heatmaps, and antenna/cable experiments.
